# Changelog

All notable changes to `effectful-postgresql` will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Haskell Package Versioning Policy](https://pvp.haskell.org).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `runWithConnectionPool` now answers nested `WithConnection` requests with the connection already in use, so `withTransaction` and `withSavepoint` cover the statements inside them instead of running each on a different pooled connection
- OpenTelemetry instrumentation support via `enable-otel` flag (transparent, no code changes required)

## [0.1.0.1] - 04.08.2025

### Changed

- Increased upper bounds on `effectful-core` to support `2.6`

## [0.1.0.0] - 22.07.2025

### Added

- 100% documentation coverage.
- Reasonably detailed READMEs
- CI that builds and tests the packages for each version of GHC in the `tested-with` field.
